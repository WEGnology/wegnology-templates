# WEGnology Templates

This repository contains WEGnology's collection of [Application Templates](https://docs.app.wnology.io/templates/overview) and [Library Templates](https://docs.app.wnology.io/template-library/overview). These templates are designed to deliver pre-built functionality to accelerate development time and provide implementation guidance and best practices.

For sandbox and enterprise customers of WEGnology's managed cloud platform, these templates can be found directly in the WEGnology user interface.

## Application Templates

Application Templates reduce the time it takes to build common types of IoT solutions by providing pre-built foundations on which you can begin developing. These templates provide a set of real-world reference implementations that you can use for:

* Architecture guidance
* Implementation best practices
* Starting points for your own applications

Application templates can be found in the WEGnology user interface whenever you create a new [Application](https://docs.app.wnology.io/applications/overview/).

## Library Templates

Library Templates provide out-of-the-box functionality that can be imported into any existing WEGnology application. Each template is self-contained and provides functionality common to many different types of applications (e.g. [Log In Form](https://github.com/WEGnology/wegnology-templates/tree/master/library-templates/experiences/forms/log-in) or [QR Code Reader](https://github.com/WEGnology/wegnology-templates/tree/master/library-templates/experiences/components/qr-code-reader)).

Library Templates can be found using the [Template Library](https://console.app.wnology.io/applications/recent/template-library) navigation link within any existing WEGnology application.
